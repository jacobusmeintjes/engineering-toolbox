# Engineering Toolbox

A curated collection of patterns, practices, and reference implementations across distributed systems, cloud architecture, and modern software engineering.

## 📋 Overview

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and reference library, documenting solutions, patterns, and best practices I've developed and refined throughout my career as a solution architect and software engineer.
